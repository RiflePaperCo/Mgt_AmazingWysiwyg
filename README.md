### Welcome to the Mgt Amazing WYSIWYG Editor for Magento

WYSIWYG ( /ˈwɪziwɪɡ/ wiz-ee-wig) is an acronym for What You See Is What You Get. 
The term is used in computing to describe a system in which content (text and graphics) displayed onscreen during editing appears in a 
form closely corresponding to its appearance when printed or displayed as a finished product, which might be a printed document, web page, or slide presentation.
